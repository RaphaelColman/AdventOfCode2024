### Thoughts ###
This puzzle is about cycles I think

Running this 10 times on just [0]

```
[0]
[1]
[2024]
[20,24]
[2,0,2,4]
[4048,1,4048,8096]
[40,48,2024,40,48,80,96]
[4,0,4,8,20,24,4,0,4,8,8,0,9,6]
[8096,1,8096,16192,2,0,2,4,8096,1,8096,16192,16192,1,18216,12144]
[80,96,2024,80,96,32772608,4048,1,4048,8096,80,96,2024,80,96,32772608,32772608,2024,36869184,24579456]
```

The length is now 10
We can see that every time we produce a 0 the cycle repeats inside
0 -> 1 -> -> 2[0]24 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2[0]24 -> 0
So every 0 is going to add an element every 3 cycles

Same for some other digits
```
[3]
[6072]
[60,72]
[6,0,7,2]
[12144,1,14168,4048]
[24579456,2024,28676032,40,48]
[2457,9456,20,24,2867,6032,4,0,4,8]
[24,57,94,56,2,0,2,4,28,67,60,32,8096,1,8096,16192]
[2,4,5,7,9,4,5,6,4048,1,4048,8096,2,8,6,7,6,0,3,2,80,96,2024,80,96,32772608]
[4048,8096,10120,14168,18216,8096,10120,12144,40,48,2024,40,48,80,96,4048,16192,12144,14168,12144,1,6072,4048,8,0,9,6,20,24,8,0,9,6,3277,2608]
```
3 -> 6072 -> ... -> [24,57,94,56,2,0,2,4,28,67,60,[3]2,8096,1,8096,16192] -> 3
So the 3 does 26 splits split every 8 cycles
But also it produces a bunch of other numbers which will cycle somehow


Much of the time, the same number keep appearing over and over again:
```
[5]
[10120]
[20482880]
[2048,2880]
[20,48,28,80]
[2,0,4,8,2,8,8,0]
[4048,1,8096,16192,4048,16192,16192,1]
[40,48,2024,80,96,32772608,40,48,32772608,32772608,2024]
[4,0,4,8,20,24,8,0,9,6,3277,2608,4,0,4,8,3277,2608,3277,2608,20,24]
[8096,1,8096,16192,2,0,2,4,16192,1,18216,12144,32,77,26,8,8096,1,8096,16192,32,77,26,8,32,77,26,8,2,0,2,4]
```

Maybe there aren't that many "seeds". Maybe you could generate some sort of map: of Integer -> Number of occurences
That's a start - we won't be operating over such a huge list then. After that we might be able to use some sort of memoization so we don't keep
calculating the same numbers over and over again



### After a map implementation
Ok it looks like it should work but I get the wrong answer. Here is the test input after 11 iterations using the old (slow) method and gathering it into a frequency map
fromList [(17,1),(125,1)]
fromList [(1,1),(7,1),(253000,1)]
fromList [(0,1),(253,1),(2024,1),(14168,1)]
fromList [(1,1),(20,1),(24,1),(512072,1),(28676032,1)]
fromList [(0,1),(2,2),(4,1),(72,1),(512,1),(2024,1),(2867,1),(6032,1)]

fromList [(0,6),(1,2),(2,1),(4,8),(6,2),(7,1),(8,5),(9,1),(20,2),(24,2),(28,1),(32,1),(60,1),(67,1),(80,4),(96,4),(1376,1),(2024,3),(2457,2),(2608,1),(2867,1),(3277,1),(4048,2),(4245,1),(6032,1),(8096,3),(9456,2),(9494,1),(9888,1),(16192,1),(24579456,1),(32772608,3),(36869184,1)]
fromList [(0,7),(1,6),(2,6),(3,1),(4,2),(6,6),(7,1),(8,6),(9,4),(13,1),(20,3),(24,5),(26,1),(28,1),(32,2),(40,2),(42,1),(45,1),(48,2),(56,2),(57,2),(60,1),(67,1),(76,1),(77,1),(80,3),(88,1),(94,4),(96,3),(98,1),(2024,2),(2457,1),(2608,3),(3277,3),(3686,1),(4048,1),(8096,8),(9184,1),(9456
,1),(12144,2),(14168,1),(16192,5),(18216,1),(32772608,1)]

and here is the test input using the new method (which uses a frequency map as its underlying structure
fromList [(17,1),(125,1)]
fromList [(1,1),(7,1),(253000,1)]
fromList [(0,1),(253,1),(2024,1),(14168,1)]
fromList [(1,1),(20,1),(24,1),(512072,1),(28676032,1)]
fromList [(0,1),(2,2),(4,1),(72,1),(512,1),(2024,1),(2867,1),(6032,1)]
fromList [(1,1),(2,1),(7,1),(20,1),(24,1),(28,1),(32,1),(60,1),(67,1),(4048,2),(8096,1),(1036288,1)]
fromList [(0,2),(2,4),(3,1),(4,1),(6,2),(7,1),(8,1),(40,2),(48,2),(80,1),(96,1),(2024,1),(4048,1),(14168,1),(2097446912,1)]
fromList [(0,3),(1,2),(4,4),(6,1),(8,3),(9,1),(20,1),(24,1),(40,1),(48,1),(4048,4),(6072,1),(8096,1),(12144,2),(14168,1),(16192,1),(20974,1),(46912,1),(28676032,1)]
fromList [(0,2),(1,3),(2,2),(4,3),(8,1),(40,4),(48,4),(60,1),(72,1),(80,1),(96,1),(2024,2),(2867,1),(6032,1),(8096,4),(12144,1),(16192,3),(18216,1),(24579456,2),(28676032,1),(32772608,1),(42451376,1),(94949888,1)]
fromList [(0,6),(1,2),(2,1),(4,8),(6,2),(7,1),(8,5),(9,1),(20,2),(24,2),(28,1),(32,1),(60,1),(67,1),(80,4),(96,4),(1376,1),(2024,3),(2457,2),(2608,1),(2867,1),(3277,1),(4048,2),(4245,1),(6032,1),(8096,3),(9456,2),(9494,1),(9888,1),(16192,1),(24579456,1),(32772608,3),(36869184,1)]
fromList [(0,7),(1,6),(2,6),(3,1),(4,2),(6,6),(7,1),(8,6),(9,4),(13,1),(20,3),(24,5),(26,1),(28,1),(32,2),(40,2),(42,1),(45,1),(48,2),(56,2),(57,2),(60,1),(67,1),(76,1),(77,1),(80,3),(88,1),(94,3),(96,3),(98,1),(2024,2),(2457,1),(2608,3),(3277,3),(3686,1),(4048,1),(8096,8),(9184,1),(9456
,1),(12144,2),(14168,1),(16192,5),(18216,1),(32772608,1)]

So on the 10th iteration, there is one more 94 in the correct set than the bad one.
This is the generation beforehand:
fromList [(0,6),(1,2),(2,1),(4,8),(6,2),(7,1),(8,5),(9,1),(20,2),(24,2),(28,1),(32,1),(60,1),(67,1),(80,4),(96,4),(1376,1),(2024,3),(2457,2),(2608,1),(2867,1),(3277,1),(4048,2),(4245,1),(6032,1),(8096,3),(9456,2),(9494,1),(9888,1),(16192,1),(24579456,1),(32772608,3),(36869184,1)]
Why does this get 4 [94] in the next iteration. To me it looks like it should get only 3
We should see what it looks like as a list I guess
Iteration 10:
[4245,1376,9494,9888,28,67,60,32,8096,1,8096,16192,4,0,4,8,20,24,4,0,4,8,8,0,9,6,80,96,2024,80,96,32772608,4048,1,4048,8096,80,96,2024,80,96,32772608,32772608,2024,36869184,24579456,4,0,4,8,3277,2608,2457,9456,2867,6032,2457,9456,20,24,6,0,7,2,4,0,4,8]
AHA!
It's the double 9494 -> [94, 94] in the next iteration. I guess I'm just counting that as one?
So basically 9494 -> IM.Map 94:2
